// EXCEPTIONS

/* 
- An object that represents an unexpected event within our application. 

- Creating an exception object and having it passed to the Java runtime is called, "throwing an exception". 

- Exceptions are used to handle when problems arise in an application. 

- Anonymous classes can be created based on any existing class or interface.
