- Constructor methods are called when objects are created to initialize the object. 

public class User {
  // fields
  
  String name;
  
  // constructor
  
  public User(String name) {
    this.name = name; 
  }
}


// new user's name is initially set to "Billy" 

User billy = new User("Billy");

// we can still manually reassign a user's name later. 

billy.name = "William";


/*************************************************/

- 'This' is referred to the current object whose method or constructor is being called. 

- You can refer to any field or method of the current object. 

public class User {
  public String name;

}
