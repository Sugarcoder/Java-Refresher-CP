- Class inheritance shares common fields and methods across related classes.

- Inheritance = two related class definitions will share the same blueprint variables and methods

Example #1 (customer and seller - share many properties, but have different roles): 

public class User {
  // attributes and methods defining a user
}

public class Customer extends User {
  // attributes and methods defining a customer
}

public class Seller extends User {
  // attributes and methods defining a seller
}



Example #2: 

public calss iOSDevice {
  protected String version = "4G"; 
  protected String driveSize = "16 GB";
  protected String screenSize; 
  
  public String getVersion() {
    return version;
  }
  
  public class iPhone extends iOSDevice {
    public iPhone() {
      this.screenSize = "320 x 480";
    }
  }
  
  public class iPad extends iOSDevice {
    public iPad() {
      this.screenSize = "768 x 1024";
    }
  }
}
